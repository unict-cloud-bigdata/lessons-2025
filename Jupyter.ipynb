    "- [Rise](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): it's an extension able to transform notebook in presentation inside the web application. The great advantage is that it's possibile to execute cell \"live\"\n",
    "- [Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): Voilà allows you to convert a Jupyter Notebook into an interactive dashboard that allows you to share your work with others.\n",
    "- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html): Quarto can render Jupyter notebooks represented as plain text (.qmd) or as a normal notebook file (.ipynb). One benefit of using .ipynb is that you can use JupyterLab as your editor."
